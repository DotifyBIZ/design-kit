# Dotify Design Kit

A versioned, brand-consistent CSS design system for Dotify sites, tools, and WordPress (Elementor).

## Purpose
The Dotify Design System provides a single source of truth for brand colors, typography, layout primitives, and UI components.
It is designed to work across plain HTML/PHP/JS projects and WordPress sites built with Elementor.

No JavaScript. No frameworks. Just clean, predictable CSS.

## Features
- Brand-driven design tokens
- Reusable components (buttons, headings, sections)
- Utility classes for layout and text
- Elementor-safe class naming (`dt-*`)
- Semantic versioning
